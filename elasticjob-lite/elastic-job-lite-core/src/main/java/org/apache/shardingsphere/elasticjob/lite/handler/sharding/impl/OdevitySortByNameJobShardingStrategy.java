 * Sharding sharding which for hash with job name to determine IP asc or desc.
 * 
 * <p>
 * IP address asc if job name' hashcode is odd;
 * IP address desc if job name' hashcode is even.
 * Used to average assign to job server.
 * 
 * For example: 
 * 1. If there are 3 job servers with 2 sharding item, and the hash value of job name is odd, then each server is divided into: 1 = [0], 2 = [1], 3 = [];
 * 2. If there are 3 job servers with 2 sharding item, and the hash value of job name is even, then each server is divided into: 3 = [0], 2 = [1], 1 = [].
