## Scheduler deployment steps

1. Start ElasticJob-Cloud-Scheduler and Mesos, and specify ZooKeeper as the registry.
2. Start Mesos Master and Mesos Agent.
3. Unzip `elasticjob-cloud-scheduler-${version}.tar.gz`.
4. Run `bin\start.sh` to start ElasticJob-Cloud-Scheduler.

## Job deployment steps

1. Ensure that ZooKeeper, Mesos Master/Agent and ElasticJob-Cloud-Scheduler have been started correctly.
2. Place the tar.gz file of the packaging job in a network accessible location, such as ftp or http. The `main` method in the packaged tar.gz file needs to call the `JobBootstrap.execute` method provided by ElasticJob-Cloud.
3. Use curl command to call RESTful API to publish applications and register jobs. For details: [Configuration](/en/user-manual/elasticjob-cloud/configuration)

## Scheduler configuration steps

Modify the `conf\elasticjob-cloud-scheduler.properties` to change the system configuration.
