ElasticJob-Lite provides a customized Spring Boot Starter, which can be used in conjunction with Spring Boot.
Developers can easily use Spring container-managed data sources and other objects in their jobs through dependency injection, and use placeholders to get values from property files.

## Job configuration

```yaml

```

## Job start

Just start Spring Boot Starter directly.
