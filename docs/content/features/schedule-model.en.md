ElasticJob is a thread-level scheduling framework for in-process.
Through it, Job can be transparently combined with business application systems.
It can be easily used in conjunction with Java frameworks such as Spring and Dubbo.
Spring DI (Dependency Injection) Beans can be freely used in Job, such as data source connection pool and Dubbo remote service, etc., which is more convenient for business development.
