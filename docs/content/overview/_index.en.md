ElasticJob is a distributed scheduling solution consisting of two separate projects, ElasticJob-Lite and ElasticJob-Cloud.

Through the functions of flexible scheduling, resource management and job management, 
it creates a distributed scheduling solution suitable for Internet scenarios, 
and provides a diversified job ecosystem through open architecture design.
It uses a unified job API for each project.
Developers only need code one time and can deploy at will.

ElasticJob became an [Apache ShardingSphere](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/) Sub project on May 28 2020.

## Introduction

Using ElasticJob can make developers no longer worry about the non-functional requirements such as jobs scale out, so that they can focus more on business coding;
At the same time, it can release operators too, so that they do not have to worry about jobs high availability and management, and can automatic operation by simply adding servers.

### ElasticJob-Lite

A lightweight, decentralized solution that provides distributed task sharding services.

### ElasticJob-Cloud

Uses Mesos to manage and isolate resources.

![ElasticJob-Cloud Architecture](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/elasticjob/current/img/architecture/elasticjob_cloud.png)

|                   | *ElasticJob-Lite* | *ElasticJob-Cloud* |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Decentralization  | Yes               | No                 |
| Resource Assign   | No                | Yes                |
| Job Execution     | Daemon            | Daemon + Transient |
| Deploy Dependency | ZooKeeper         | ZooKeeper + Mesos  |
